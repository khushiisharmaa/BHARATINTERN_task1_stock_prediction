## Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Keras (a deep learning library built on top of TensorFlow or Theano)

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

### Data Collection

To predict AAPL stock prices, you'll need historical price data. You can use financial APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Quandl to fetch this data. For simplicity, let's assume you have a CSV file named `AAPL.csv` with columns 'Date' and 'Close' that contain the historical closing prices.

### Data Preprocessing

1. Import the required libraries.
2. Load the AAPL stock price data from the CSV file.
3. Preprocess the data by normalizing it to scale values between 0 and 1.
4. Split the data into training and testing sets.

### LSTM Model

1. Build an LSTM model for stock price prediction. You can customize the number of LSTM layers, units, and other hyperparameters.
2. Compile the model with a suitable loss function and optimizer.
3. Train the model on the training data.

### Model Evaluation

1. Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
2. Plot the actual vs. predicted stock prices for visual inspection.

### Predictions

1. Use the trained LSTM model to make predictions on the testing dataset.
2. You can also use the model to predict future stock prices by providing the necessary input data.

### Running the Code

You can run the Python code to perform the above steps. Make sure to adjust hyperparameters and model architecture as needed. Here's a basic structure of the code:

```python
# Import libraries and load data

# Data preprocessing

# Build LSTM model

# Compile the model

# Train the model

# Model evaluation

# Make predictions
```

### Conclusion

This README provides an overview of the steps required to create a stock price prediction model using LSTM for AAPL. Keep in mind that stock price prediction is a complex task, and model performance may vary. Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and additional features to improve prediction accuracy.

*Good luck with your stock price prediction project!*
